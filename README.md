Added tokensanity, scrubsanity, Medigoron, and Carpet Salesman, but only for base logic. No point adding it for two retired rulesets.

Added a counter for triforce hunt. (Combined tunics to fit it in the grid.)

Reset Tracker button is functional now. Just make sure the Save Locations and Items is set to off in order to use it. I added that setting so that accidental refreshes won't wipe all progress.

<b>To do:</b>

Shopsanity maybe? Unsure best method currently.

Allow free organizing of items. (Seems like there was an attempt to implement this, but it was never finished.)

Probably impossible: Make it cooperate in Firefox. Sometimes it works without adblock, but never works with adblock on. Inspect shows an error with the items module not loading. Error has never happened on Chrome. After some googling it seems to be a problem with Firefox that I can't work around.
